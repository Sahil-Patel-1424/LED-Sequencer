# LED-Sequencer
A project where I press on and it sequentially turns all 5 LEDs on, turns them all off, and repeats the cycle. I utilized multiple LEDs, a button, and a finite state machine. I got the inspiration to do this project from this Arduino tutorial: https://forum.arduino.cc/t/yet-another-finite-state-machine-introduction/1198997.
